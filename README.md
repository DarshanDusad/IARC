# IARC
This is for the autonomous event of IIT Kanpur Techfest, Techkriti
USP:
1. Line following
2. Wall Following
3. Matrix (6x6 cm2) reading
4. Precise angle Turning
5. Colour sensing.

### Progress and Workflow:

## (28 Jan-29 Jan)
Discussed the PS.
Possible sensors etc.
We'll be making a color sensor ourselves instead of purchasing one. With?Without filter wasn't sure at that time.
For line following LSA08.
Problems faced:
How we would turn precise angle in that bot.?
How to detect that 2x2 matrix with the already positioned sensor array. 

## (1 Feb-5 Feb)
Decided we'll be using gyroscope foe angle turning. <br />
Built and tested the colour sensing module. <br />
Built a chassis for basic LSA08 Testing, as it's delicate and needs precision. <br />
## (9 Feb-16 Feb)
Read the manual of LSA, all three modes, Serial, analog, digital.
We are using analog for basic line following. (For now)(PD too)
Line following was done. Code & Video for the same are uploaded.
